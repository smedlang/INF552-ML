Homework 4

In this assignment, we look at different ways of handling missing data (SMOTE and other data imputation techniques). Also we used a couple different methods for selecting a subset of best features in our pretty large dataset. For this project, I relied heavily on scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and python-weka-wrapper3, and used xgboost, seaborn and matplotlib as well.

Note:
I was unable to get SMOTE to run without Java heap error (even after the advice from Piazza of increasing max_heap_size) so the SMOTE K_Folds is set to 2.
