#### Homework 2

This assignment analyzes linear, non-linear, and KNN regression models using Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Combined+Cycle+Power+Plant. 

We look at which predictors in the dataset (hourly average ambient variables temperature, ambient pressure, relative humidity, and exhaust vacuum) can predict the net hourly electrical energy output of the powerplant. 

Notes:
  - I used libraries sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, and statsmodels, to complete this assignment.
